# WEBRTC-CYBERSEC
**Boston University EC601 Term Project:** *Testing security vulnerabilities in WebRTC technologies.*

**Authors: Wiley Hunt and Apollo Lo**

Our project involves exploring vulnerabilities in WebRTC and associated applications in order to understand potential risks posed to users. This project is being conducted in an agile fashion over multiple "Sprints." The Associated ReadME's for each sprint can be found [here](https://github.com/whunt1965/WEBRTC-CYBERSEC/tree/main/Cache/SprintReadMes).

## Contents
* **[MalciousWebRTCApplication](https://github.com/whunt1965/WEBRTC-CYBERSEC/tree/main/MaliciousWebRTCApplication):** Contains a number of scripts designed to use core WebRTC API's/features in a malcious manner. In particular, the folder includes two examples of a WebRTC application that can be used to bug the computer of another user. 
* **[MiTM](https://github.com/whunt1965/WEBRTC-CYBERSEC/tree/main/MiTM):** An example of exploiting a WebRTC application by using a malicious signalling server to conduct a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack on a WebRTC session between two users.
