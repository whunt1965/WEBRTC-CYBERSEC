# Sprint 1

## Project Mission
Conduct an intensive exploration in how WebRTC technologies can be exploited to better understand how malicious hackers might perform attacks.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
As an initial step in this exploration, we will:
* Experiment with WebRTC JavaScript API's to see how they might be be abused
* Create a malicious WebRTC application to take control of user media
* Create a malicious TURN server to execute MiTM attacks

## User Stories
WebRTC is widely available in popular browsers and the technology is becoming increasingly common (WebRTC is used by number of well-known applications, such as Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger). As such, it's important that even the casual user understand any potential vulnerabilities that the the WebRTC in their browser might have or how malicious Javascript could be used to access user media devices (or capture information such as a user's IP).
