# Exploiting a TURN server
This repository contains the tools we utilized while exploring how a malicious party might compromise the information collected by a TURN server.

## Background

### What is a TURN server?

We quickly realized we needed a TURN server to get through the firewalls and establish a connection.

### How and why would an attacker compromise a TURN server?

## Attack Exploration

### Set-Up
In setting up our MiTM attack online, we ran into the issue where users who were behind firewalls could not connect via WebRTC. So, to get around these firewalls, we both set up TURN Servers using [coTurn - an open source TURN Server project](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) on Google Cloud Compute engine virtual machines (using previously acquired domain names for each TURN Server). In setting up these TURN servers, we followed a number of different tutorials, but found [this article](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1175/how-to-create-and-configure-your-own-stun-turn-server-with-coturn-in-ubuntu-18-04) to be the most useful given that we were using Ubuntu systems.
