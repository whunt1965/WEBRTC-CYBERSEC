# Exploiting a TURN server
This repository contains the tools we utilized while exploring how a malicious party might compromise the information collected by a TURN server.

## Background

### What is a TURN server?

A TURN (**T**raversal **U**sing **R**elay around **N**AT) server is used for relaying network traffic. In a WebRTC context, a TURN server is utilized when a direct Peer-to-Peer connection is not possible, and instead the TURN server serves as intermediary to send packets (media streams, data, etc.) between peers. The below image shows how a TURN server may be used (in addition to signalling and STUN servers) as part of a WebRTC session.

### How and why would an attacker compromise a TURN server?

## Attack Exploration

### Set-Up
In setting up our MiTM attack online, we ran into the issue where users who were behind firewalls could not connect via WebRTC. So, to get around these firewalls, we both set up TURN Servers using [coTurn - an open source TURN Server project](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) on Google Cloud Compute engine virtual machines (using previously acquired domain names for each TURN Server). In setting up these TURN servers, we followed a number of different tutorials, but found [this article](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/1175/how-to-create-and-configure-your-own-stun-turn-server-with-coturn-in-ubuntu-18-04) to be the most useful given that we were using Ubuntu systems.

Set-up instructions and an example configuration file are included in the [ExampleConfig folder](https://github.com/whunt1965/WEBRTC-CYBERSEC/tree/main/TurnExploits/ExampleConfig).
