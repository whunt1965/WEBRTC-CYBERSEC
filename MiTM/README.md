# Conducting a MiTM Attack on a WebRTC application
This repository contains our efforts to conduct a MiTM attack on a WebRTC application. 

To begin, we pulled the source code for the [Realtime communication with WebRTC codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/webrtc-web/#0), which is available in [this Github Repository](//github.com/googlecodelabs/webrtc-web). 

We chose to use this codelab as a basis because it specifically provides instructions for setting up a signalling server for the application. While we previously intended to compromise a TURN server in order to perform the attack, further research (specifically [this account(https://webrtchacks.com/webrtc-and-man-in-the-middle-attacks/) ] on a successful WebRTC MiTM attack by Alan Johnston led us to realize that we needed to begin by compromising the TURN server.
